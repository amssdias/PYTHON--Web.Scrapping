# Scraping quotes

In this repository I'm scrapping books, author and tags from a website. Testing my skills, using a very well structured code within the folders.

Website used to scrape: [books.toscrape.com/](https://books.toscrape.com/)

## Pre requisites

  #### To install:
  After installing **Python** open your terminal window and type:
  - ```pip install requests```
  - ```pip install beautifulsoup4```


## Run

Download the folder, open your terminal window on the project folder and type:
```
python app.py
```

You will get a list of all quotes from the website.
