# Browser automation with Selenium

Now we're launching a browser instead of requesting the page with Python. We will be controlling the browser, instead of just getting HTML.

## Requirements

- Selenium library
- A webdriver

### Selenium

Install `selenium` using PyCharm's preferences panel or in your virtual environment.

### Webdriver
