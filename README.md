# Python Web Scrapping

This is a practice repository for Web Scraping. We are scrapping few websites in different ways.

## Pre requisites

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - 3.8.4 or up


## Pipfile and Pipfile.Lock

Inside the Pipfile there's all the modules name needed for the projects in the folders.
Download Pipenv through the terminal window (make sure you have Python installed), just type `pip install pipenv`.

After installing pipenv all you have to do is to download these two files and in terminal window, got to the folder with these files and run `pipenv install` and automatically will install this modules.

This will create a virtual environment with the modules `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium` and `requests`.

To run this virtual environment all you must do is run `pipenv shell` and to close the virtual environment `exit`.

If any doubts here's a link to some more explanations:
